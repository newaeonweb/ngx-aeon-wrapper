# NgxAeonWrapper

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.13.

## What is it or what does this project do?

The intention of this project is to create reusable components encapsulating their use, so it is possible to use any UI framework such as Angular Material, Bootstrap, Bulma, among others.

By default we use Angular Material.

Feel free to contribute.

## How to use

Just install like any other npm package:

```
npm i ngx-aeon-wrapper
```

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project ngx-aeon-wrapper` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project ngx-aeon-wrapper`.

> Note: Don't forget to add `--project ngx-aeon-wrapper` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file.

## Build

Run `ng build ngx-aeon-wrapper` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build ngx-aeon-wrapper`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/ngx-aeon-wrapper` and run `npm publish`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test ngx-aeon-wrapper` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
